This repository provides tools for analyzing audio signals using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** and its inverse. It includes utilities to visualize waveforms, spectrograms, and apply low-pass filtering to audio signals. The implementation is built using Python, with support for both Plotly and Seaborn visualizations.

##  Features

### `FastFourierTransforms` class
-  Recursive 1D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
-  Inverse FFT (iFFT)
-  Low-pass filtering with adjustable frequency retention

### `AudioSignalAnalyzer` class
-  Plot audio waveforms using Plotly and Seaborn
-  Plot spectrograms with customizable layout
-  Compare original and filtered signals visually

##  Example Use Cases

- Visualize how an audio signal changes after applying FFT.
- Remove high-frequency noise using a low-pass filter.
- Compare original and reconstructed audio signals using waveform and spectrogram plots.
